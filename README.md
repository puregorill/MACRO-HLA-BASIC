# MACRO HLA BASIC

The files are a macro collection for the Commodore 64 (NMOS 6502/6510).
More concretely it contains a so-called Solution (a form of the project) for the C64Studio, which has an ACME Cross Assembler-like syntax. The macros can of course also be used without the C64Studio (with the Cross Assembler ACME, whose syntax the files just have).

The whole project and also parts of the code are heavily influenced and inspired by the following project:
