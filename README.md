# MACRO HLA BASIC

The files are a macro collection for the Commodore 64 (NMOS 6502/6510).
More concretely it contains a so-called Solution (a form of the project) for the C64Studio, which has an ACME Cross Assembler-like syntax. The macros can of course also be used without the C64Studio (with the Cross Assembler ACME, whose syntax the files just have).

C64Studio:

The whole project and also parts of the code are heavily influenced and inspired by the following project:
